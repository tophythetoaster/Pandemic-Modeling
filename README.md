Project: Pandemic-Modeling

This is a random graph-based approach to pandemic modeling. 

Functionality:
A population is an array consisting of people objects. A people object has various attributes, the most important of which is its demographic. A demographic object has two types of parameters: spread parameters which determine how likely members of this demographic are to transmit and receive the virus, and threshold parameters which reflect members of this demographic's tolerance to the virus.
